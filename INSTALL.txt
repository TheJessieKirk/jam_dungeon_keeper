To INSTALL JAM: Dungeon Keeper, copy the DATA folder from the jam_dungeon_keeper-0.1.1.zip archive to your Dungeon Keeper installation directory. This will replace your existing CREATURES.TXT file, but will also add a backup file of the original CREATURES.TXT file as CREATURES.TXT.BAK.

To UNINSTALL, delete the CREATURES.TXT file from the DATA folder, which is located inside your Dungeon Keeper installation directory. Then, rename CREATURES.TXT.BAK to CREATURES.TXT.
